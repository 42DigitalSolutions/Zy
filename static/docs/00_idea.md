# Zy

Your personal AI assistant/OS with an integrated AI store.

## Vision

The goal of this open source project is to build a distributed AI assistant with full data management capabilities, which will run in the cloud. The AI assistant will primarily take voice inputs and process them into conversations, enabling users to perform tasks and get information in a conversational manner.

## Features

The following are the key features that we envision for Zy:

- Voice Input: The primary input method for the assistant will be voice, enabling users to interact with the system hands-free.
- Conversation-based Interaction: Everything will be a conversation, allowing users to engage in natural language interactions and get responses in a conversational manner.
- Data Management: Zy will have full data management capabilities, allowing it to collect, store, and manage user data.
- Distributed Architecture: Zy will have a distributed architecture, enabling it to be run in the cloud and scale to support a large number of users.
- Anonymized Data Pass-out: The data passed out to external systems will always be anonymized, ensuring user privacy.
- AI-Store: The AI-Store feature of Zy is designed to allow third party developers to add their own AI components or models to extend its functionality. This can include anything from custom machine learning algorithms to integrations with other AI services like sentiment analysis APIs. These extensions would be available within the AI-Assistant's interface, giving users easy access to these additional tools without having to leave the main application.

## Goals

The primary goals of this project are to create an open source AI assistant that is easy to use, respects user privacy, and provides a platform for developers to build upon. The project will focus on creating a modular and extensible architecture that can be easily customized and extended by developers to meet their specific use cases.

## Roadmap

The following is a high-level roadmap for this project:

Phase 1: Build a basic AI assistant that can understand voice inputs and respond in a conversational manner.

Phase 2: Add data management capabilities to the assistant, enabling it to collect and store user data in a secure and private manner.

Phase 3: Create a distributed architecture for the assistant, enabling it to be run in the cloud and scale to support a large number of users.

Phase 4: Create messenger apps for end user.

Phase 5: Add anonymization capabilities to the assistant, ensuring that user data is always protected when passed out to external systems.

Phase 6: Build up the AI-Store.

Phase 7: Create a platform for developers to build upon, providing a modular and extensible architecture that can be easily customized and extended to meet specific use cases.

## _Organization_

_To achieve our goals, we plan to establish a non-profit organization that will support the development and maintenance of the open source AI assistant. The organization will provide resources such as funding, expertise, and infrastructure to the development team, while ensuring that the project remains open source and accessible to everyone._

_We believe that an open source AI assistant can have a significant impact on society, and we are committed to creating a community-driven project that can address the needs of a wide range of users. By working together, we can create an AI assistant that is both powerful and accessible to all._

## Conclusion

The open source AI assistant project aims to build a distributed AI assistant with full data management capabilities that respects user privacy and provides a platform for developers to build upon. With its voice input and conversational interface, the AI assistant aims to simplify tasks and make interactions more natural and human-like. The project roadmap outlines a clear path for achieving these goals, with a focus on building a modular and extensible architecture that can be easily customized and extended to meet specific use cases.
