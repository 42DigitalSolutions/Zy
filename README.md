# Zy üêô

Your personal AI assistant/OS with an integrated AI store.

## Manifesto

With Zy we want to give the user its own private, personal and personalized AI Assistant.
With the current state of the discussions within the tech community it is not clear if the existence of an AGI is the best of all ideas.

Beside the ethical and intellectual challenges we as AI enthusiasts ask ourselves if we want to have all our personal data in one or few big Cooperates datacenters without any control of use and misuse.We believe that a lot is possible with the current state of technology and we understand that non technical users have a hard time to utilize AIs for their needs.

## How

With Zy we intend to do three things:

- Train/Finetune a NLU to understand a request from its user and orchestrate the user request to specialized AIs to solve the request or parts of the request and present the results back to the user.
- Build up an AI store, where other developers and companies can offer their trained models for free or a subscription fee to the user. Like the App stores do on mobile devices.
- Implement a Messenger for our end user to interact with their personal assistant.

We believe in the power of the (AI) community and feel confident that a lot will be possible once a gateway between developers and users is established.
